- [Feature Comparison](#feature-comparison) — Detailed comparison table

## Extension types

ONLYOFFICE supports three extension methods, each designed for specific use cases:

### Plugins

Plugins are HTML/CSS/JavaScript applications embedded in the ONLYOFFICE editor interface. They provide custom UI elements and can integrate with external services.

**Use cases:**
- Embedding external content ([YouTube](../samples/plugin-samples/youtube.md), media galleries)
- Third-party service integration ([Translator](../samples/plugin-samples/translator.md), [Zotero](../samples/plugin-samples/zotero.md), CRM systems)
- Advanced document processing ([OCR](../samples/plugin-samples/ocr.md), image manipulation, data visualization)
- Custom workflows (form builders, approval systems, templates)

**Development requirements:**
- **Time:** 2-7 days
- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Distribution:** [ONLYOFFICE Marketplace](https://www.onlyoffice.com/app-directory/en) or private deployment

### Macros

Macros are JavaScript code snippets that execute directly within documents. They require no installation and run in the document context.

**Use cases:**
- Automated formatting (applying complex styles)
- Batch operations (find-replace, bulk updates)
- Custom calculations (specialized formulas, data transformations)
- Document cleanup (metadata removal, formatting standardization)

**Development requirements:**
- **Time:** 30 minutes - 2 hours
- **Skill level:** Beginner
- **Technologies:** JavaScript
- **Distribution:** Copy-paste or embed in document templates

### AI Integration

AI-enabled plugins combine standard plugin capabilities with AI service integration for advanced document processing.

**Use cases:**
- Writing assistance (grammar checking, style suggestions, content generation)
- Document summarization (key point extraction, abstract creation)
- Context-aware translation (preserving formatting and tone)
- Data analysis (spreadsheet analysis, report generation)

**Development requirements:**
- **Time:** 3-10 days
- **Skill level:** Advanced
- **Technologies:** Plugin API, AI provider integration (OpenAI, Claude, or custom services)
- **Additional requirements:** API keys for AI services

## Choosing an approach

Use the following decision tree to select the appropriate extension method:

```
START
    │
    ├─ Do you need a custom user interface (buttons, forms, panels)?
    │   │
    │   ├─ YES → Do you need to connect external services (APIs, databases)?
    │   │   │
    │   │   ├─ YES → Use Plugins
    │   │   │         (Full capabilities: UI + external integrations)
    │   │   │
    │   │   └─ NO → Use Plugins
    │   │             (UI-focused: custom panels and controls)
    │   │
    │   └─ NO → Do you need to connect external services?
    │       │
    │       ├─ YES → Use Plugins
    │       │         (Background integration without UI)
    │       │
    │       └─ NO → Use Macros
    │                 (Document automation without UI)
    │
    └─ Do you need AI-powered features?
        │
        └─ Use AI-Enabled Plugins
           (Plugin capabilities with AI provider integration)
```

Refer to the [Feature Comparison](#feature-comparison) table for detailed information.

## Feature comparison

The following table compares the capabilities of each extension method:

| Feature | Plugins | Macros | AI-Enabled Plugins |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------------|

| **Installation** | Required (marketplace or manual) | Not required (embedded in documents) | Required (same as plugins) |
| **User Interface** | Full custom UI support | No UI | Full custom UI support |
| **External APIs** | Supported (REST, GraphQL, etc.) | Not supported | Supported (AI services required) |
| **Offline Functionality** | Depends on implementation | Fully offline | Requires internet connection |
| **Skill Level** | Intermediate | Beginner | Advanced |
| **Development Time** | 2-7 days | 30 minutes - 2 hours | 3-10 days |
| **Distribution** | Marketplace, GitHub, private deployment | Copy-paste, templates | Marketplace, private deployment |
| **Primary Use Case** | Reusable tools, integrations | Personal automation | AI-powered features |
| **Framework Support** | React, Vue, Angular supported | Vanilla JavaScript only | Any framework supported |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can plugins access files outside ONLYOFFICE?

No. Plugins run in a sandboxed browser environment with the following capabilities:
- Access to current document content
- HTTP requests to external APIs (if configured)
- Browser localStorage for data storage

Plugins cannot access the local filesystem or other applications.

### Do plugins require a server?

**Development:** No server required. Plugins can be developed entirely client-side using local files.

**Production:** Server requirements depend on plugin functionality:
- **Client-only plugins** (no external APIs): No server required
- **API integrations**: Backend server or serverless functions required
- **AI features:** API endpoints required (self-hosted or third-party services)

### Can plugins be monetized?

Yes. Available monetization options:
- License sales through your own website
- Freemium models (basic free, premium paid)
- Paid support and customization services
- Independent distribution of paid plugins (ONLYOFFICE Marketplace currently hosts free plugins)

### Are frontend frameworks supported?

Yes. Any frontend framework can be used for plugin development. Requirements:
- Final output must be standard HTML/CSS/JS
- Bundle size should be under 5MB (recommended)
- Plugin must load correctly in an iframe environment

Common build tools: Vite, Webpack

### How are plugins debugged?

Use browser DevTools for debugging:
1. Right-click on the plugin UI
2. Select "Inspect Element"
3. Use Console, Network, and Sources tabs

[Detailed debugging guide →](../tutorials/developing/for-web-editors.md)

### What are the main limitations?

Key constraints:
- Plugin package size limit: 50MB (use CDN for large libraries)
- Some browser APIs are blocked in iframe context (use plugin API alternatives)
- Heavy operations may impact editor performance (use Web Workers)
- CORS restrictions apply for external APIs
- External APIs require internet connectivity (implement offline fallbacks)
- Feature availability varies by editor type (check `EditorsSupport` in configuration)

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Plugin not visible** | • Verify `config.json` contains a unique GUID<br/>• Check file paths are correct<br/>• Restart ONLYOFFICE |
| **JavaScript errors** | • Open browser DevTools (F12)<br/>• Check Console for error messages<br/>• Verify `plugins.js` is loaded |
| **API method failures** | • Confirm ONLYOFFICE version supports the method<br/>• Verify method syntax in [API reference](../interacting-with-editors/overview/overview.md)<br/>• Check editor type compatibility |

### Macro Issues

| Problem | Solution |
